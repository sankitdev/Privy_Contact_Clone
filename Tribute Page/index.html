            <h3>Here is the timline of Gautama Buddha Life:</h3>
            <div>
                <p class="p">The dates of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, have been a concern of, primarily, Western scholars for
                    well over 100 years now owing to the particularly Western need for precise dating of historical
                    persons and events. The problem with precise dating of the Buddha's life is that it is simply not
                    possible due to a lack of supporting primary sources.</p>

                <p class="p">This is not to exclude modern-day Eastern scholars who strive for the same nor to denigrate efforts
                    at precision in historical dating, but ancient historians did not have the same need for exact dates
                    that modern-day scholars obsess over and so, as Buddhist scholarship amply proves, efforts at
                    arriving at set dates are bound to be frustrating and ultimately futile; though this has not stopped
                    anyone from the attempt.</p>

                <p class="p">
                    The dates of the Buddha have been derived from various chronologies which all recognize that
                    Siddhartha Gautama lived for 80 years but disagree on the dates those 80 years encompass. The
                    chronologies are :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>c. 624 - c. 544 BCE</span>- Something happened we dont know about</li>
                    <li><span> c. 567 - c. 487 BCE</span>- Something happened we dont know about</li>
                    <li><span> c. 448 - c. 368 BCE</span>- Something happened we dont know about</li>
                    <li><span> c. 563 - c. 483 BCE</span>- Something happened we dont know about</li>
                </ul>
